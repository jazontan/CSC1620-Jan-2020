#This is the code example for alternative exercise from Lecture 2 slide 16.

#Lets write a simple program to determine if you can afford to buy:
#1 orange : RM 1.00
#1 apple : RM 1.50
#1 mango : RM 4.00
#You have a starting total cash of : RM 15
#If you cannot afford all fruits, the priority is to buy : mango > apple > orange

#CODE STARTS BELOW
total_cash = 15
mango = 4
apple = 1.50
orange = 1

if total_cash < orange:
  print ("You cannot afford to buy any fruits")

if total_cash >= mango:
  print ("You can afford one mango")
  total_cash = total_cash - mango

if total_cash >= apple:
  print ("You can afford one apple")
  total_cash = total_cash - apple

if total_cash >= orange:
  print ("You can afford one orange")
